# Maplins switch

This is a simple wrapper script to [Raspberry Strogonanoff](https://github.com/dmcg/raspberry-strogonanoff) it allows me to (for example) say things like:

```
% switch.py -s tank -a on
```

Which is nicer than having to remember the channel and button numbers. It also runs the sudo for you.
